/**
 * Express Middleware Architecture — Build the Pipeline
 *
 * This Express app already has TWO routers mounted (/posts and /users) and NO
 * custom middleware written yet. Your job is to write three middleware and mount
 * them correctly:
 *
 *   1) requestId — attaches a UUID to req (and the X-Request-Id header)   [GLOBAL]
 *   2) logger    — logs method, path, and status                          [GLOBAL]
 *   3) timing    — logs how many milliseconds the request took            [GLOBAL]
 *
 * Then show ONE example of PER-ROUTE mounting vs GLOBAL mounting by mounting the
 * provided `auditWrite` middleware on a single route only (see routes/posts.js).
 *
 * Run it with:  npm start
 */

const express = require('express');

// Import the routers
const postsRouter = require('./routes/posts');
const usersRouter = require('./routes/users');

// Import the custom middleware
const requestId = require('./middleware/requestId');

const timing = require('./middleware/timing');

const app = express();

// Built-in middleware to parse JSON request bodies
app.use(express.json());

// Global Middleware
// Order is important!
// requestId should run first so logger and timing can access req.id
app.use(requestId);
app.use(logger);
app.use(timing);

// Mount the routers
app.use('/posts', postsRouter);
app.use('/users', usersRouter);

// Start the server

  console.log(`API listening on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
